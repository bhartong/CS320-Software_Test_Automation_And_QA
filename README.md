<h2><b>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</b></h2>

I can ensure that my code is functional by running tests that verify expected outputs. When a variable has a maximum length, as in 10, then running tests setting that variable to 9, 10, and 11 will test that the maximum length of 10 was programmed correctly.

<h2><b>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</b></h2>

I interpret user needs by going over what they expect the program to do. Using this information, I write out requirements that will lead to the creation of tests that will verify the program requirements.

<h2><b>How do I approach designing software?</b></h2>

I approch designing software by taking down all the expected requirements of the program. Using this information I try to break the program into as many pieces that I can. I then write and test each of these sections separately verifying they work as expected. After making sure those parts work, I start to combine them together and test again to verify functionality.
